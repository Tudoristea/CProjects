# CProjects
Some projects I coded in the 3 weeks of studying C.
C is the third language I studied in my first year at Imperial College London.
Tutorials.zip containts some exercises I wrote using vim while SSH-ing into another computer. 
Those were helpful at first to understand pointers and Makefiles.
I also dove deeper into terminal commands and how C code is compiled.
The arm folder contains a bigger project I coded alongside two of my classmates. The spec can also be found in this repository.
This project is farely compelx and is the biggest C coding preoject I ever took part in.
I hope you will use the code shown here to get an idea of my codying capabilities as of June 2020.
